// Case Study -01 
// Our chat application relies heavily on WebSockets for real-time communication. 
// Currently, we have a single global WebSocket server handling millions of connections. 
// This approach seems unsustainable as the user base grows. 
// What alternative architectures or optimization techniques can you suggest to improve the scalability and performance of our chat system, specifically focusing on WebSocket handling? 
// Explain the pros and cons of each approach and your recommendations based on our scenario.

// We want to strike a balance between security and performance. Can you propose a multi-layered security strategy for our CloudFront deployment, considering the following requirements:

// Protect against common web application attacks like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).
// Enforce strict access control for protected content based on user roles and permissions.
// Minimize exposure of sensitive data by using encryption and secure headers.
// Maintain a performant user experience for global customers.
// Explain your proposed architecture, including specific CloudFront features and integrations like AWS WAF, IAM, and Key Management Service (KMS). 
// Discuss the trade-offs involved and justify your choices based on the given requirements."
